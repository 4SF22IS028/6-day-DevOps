#  Day 6 – Making the Kubernetes Website Interactive and Kubectl Commands  

On Day 6, I focused on enhancing the Kubernetes website, making it interactive and engaging. Additionally, I explored several useful kubectl commands to manage and interact with Kubernetes clusters efficiently.

#  Objective:
Enhance the Kubernetes Website: Make the website more interactive by adding features for real-time interaction with Kubernetes resources.

Learn and Execute Kubectl Commands: Work with kubectl, the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters, to perform various operations.

# commands

>vi cluster.sh
(copy from git right click)
chmod 777 cluster.sh
>ls
>sh cluster.sh
>create a user in aws
>come to server type
>aws configure
copy id from aws n paste in server
copy secret key n paste
region name:us-east-1
next leave blank enter
>eksctl
>eksctl create cluster --name deekshitha-cluster --version 1.31 --region us-east-1 --nodegroup-name test-Linux --node-type t2.micro --nodes 3 --nodes-min 3 --nodes-max 5 --managed
>snap install kubectl --classic
>aws wks update-kubeconfig --name deekshitha-cluster --region us-east-1
>kubectl get nodes

#  Enhancements to Kubernetes Website:
Interactivity with Kubernetes Resources:

Integrated interactive elements to allow users to manage Kubernetes resources directly from the website.

Added features like creating, updating, and deleting resources such as Pods, Deployments, and Services via simple UI buttons.

Used JavaScript and APIs to connect the front-end with the Kubernetes cluster and execute commands dynamically.

User Experience Improvements:

Improved user feedback by providing real-time status updates after actions (e.g., success or failure of pod deployment).

Added notification alerts to notify users about resource status changes (e.g., when a pod is successfully deployed or deleted).

Implemented interactive dashboards showing cluster resource usage (like CPU, memory) and application health.

# Backend Integration:

Integrated the website’s backend with Kubernetes API to retrieve cluster information such as active pods, services, and namespaces.

Enabled actions like scaling pods, creating new services, and viewing logs of specific containers in real-time.

# Kubectl Commands Executed:
To better manage and interact with the Kubernetes cluster, I practiced the following kubectl commands:

#  View all running Pods in the current namespace
<pre><code>kubectl get pods</code></pre>

#  Get more detailed information about a specific Pod
<pre><code>kubectl describe pod <pod_name> </code></pre>

#  View services running in the Kubernetes cluster
<pre><code>kubectl get services</code></pre>

#  Apply a new deployment using a YAML configuration file
<pre><code>kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml</code></pre>

#  Scale the number of replicas in a deployment
<pre><code>kubectl scale deployment <deployment_name> --replicas=3</code></pre>

#  Delete a specific Pod from the cluster
<pre><code>kubectl delete pod <pod_name></code></pre>

#  View logs from a specific pod/container
<pre><code>kubectl logs <pod_name> -c <container_name></code></pre>

#  Get detailed information about the nodes in the cluster
<pre><code>kubectl get nodes</code></pre>

#  Execute a command in a running pod (for debugging)
<pre><code>kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- /bin/bash</code></pre>

#  Apply changes and configurations using kubectl
<pre><code>kubectl apply -f <config_file>.yaml</code></pre>

#  Sample deployment.yaml:

<pre><code> apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: interactive-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: interactive-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: interactive-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: interactive-app
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80</code></pre>
        
# Key Learnings:
Website Interactivity with Kubernetes:

By integrating Kubernetes APIs with a front-end framework, I learned how to create a real-time interactive experience where users can manage Kubernetes resources directly from a web interface.

Understanding how to manipulate Kubernetes resources (Pods, Deployments, Services) via a UI provided a valuable learning experience in full-stack development with Kubernetes.

Kubectl Mastery:

Practiced kubectl commands to interact with the Kubernetes cluster and perform operations like deploying resources, viewing logs, and scaling applications.

Learned to retrieve detailed information about resources and monitor the health and status of applications in the cluster.

Real-Time Updates:

Implemented real-time status updates within the website to inform users of the success or failure of their operations, enhancing the overall user experience.

Debugging with Kubectl:

Used kubectl exec to enter into running pods for debugging purposes, helping to diagnose and resolve issues in real-time.

#  Next Steps:
Enhance User Interface: Improve the design and usability of the website for better user experience and resource management.

Add More Kubernetes Operations: Implement additional Kubernetes management features, such as handling Secrets, ConfigMaps, and Persistent Volumes.

Explore Multi-Cluster Management: Investigate how to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters and provide a unified management interface.

# Summary of Day-6:
Made the Kubernetes website interactive, allowing users to directly interact with the Kubernetes resources and view real-time updates.

Practiced important kubectl commands to manage and monitor resources in the cluster.

Gained hands-on experience with both Kubernetes resource management and web application development, merging them to create an interactive platform for Kubernetes users.
