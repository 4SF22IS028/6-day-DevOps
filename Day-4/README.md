# Kubernetes Learning Journey

# Day 4 – What I Learned on Kubernetes

# Overview
Today, I deepened my understanding of Kubernetes, focusing on its core components for managing containerized applications. Kubernetes is essential for orchestrating, scaling, and maintaining containerized applications in a cloud-native environment.

# What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers. It allows you to manage your containers in a distributed system, ensuring high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.

# Key Concepts Learned


🔹 Pods - The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object that represents a single instance of a running process in the cluster.
🔹 ReplicaSets - Ensures a specified number of replicas of a Pod are running at any given time.
🔹 Deployments - Manages Pods and ReplicaSets, enabling declarative updates to applications.
🔹 Services - Exposes applications running on a set of Pods to the outside world, supporting load balancing.
🔹 Namespaces - Provides a mechanism for isolating resources in a multi-tenant environment.
🔹 ConfigMaps & Secrets - Used for storing and managing application configurations and sensitive information.
🔹 Horizontal Pod Autoscaling - Automatically scales Pods based on observed CPU utilization or custom metrics.
🛠️ Commands Practiced

#  Create a Pod
<pre><code>kubectl run mypod --image=nginx</code></pre>

#  View all running Pods
<pre><code>kubectl get pods</code></pre>

#  Expose a Pod as a Service
<pre><code>kubectl expose pod mypod --port=80 --type=NodePort</code></pre>

#  Scale a deployment
<pre><code>kubectl scale deployment mydeployment --replicas=3</code></pre>

#  View cluster services
kubectl get services

#  Apply a configuration from a YAML file
<pre><code>kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml</code></pre>

#  Check logs of a running Pod
<pre><code>kubectl logs mypod</code></pre>

#  What I Understood

 Kubernetes automates container orchestration and deployment.
 Pods are the basic building blocks for running containers in Kubernetes.
 ReplicaSets ensure high availability by maintaining the desired number of replicas.
 Deployments allow for easy management of application updates and rollbacks.
 Services expose Pods and provide load balancing for distributed applications.
 Namespaces help isolate resources in large, multi-tenant clusters.
 ConfigMaps and Secrets offer secure management of application configurations and sensitive data.
 Horizontal Pod Autoscaling helps manage resource consumption by scaling Pods based on demand.
